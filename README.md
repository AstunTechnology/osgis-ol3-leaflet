# Practical OpenLayers 3 & Leaflet

A hands on introduction to using OpenLayer 3 (ol3) and Leaflet to display spatial data on the web. The workshop will introduce the two libraries, the underpinning concepts and strengths of each, and take delegates through creating a series of examples.

## What we will build

The workshop walks through building the same simple web mapping application first using OpenLayers 3 and then with Leaflet. The steps break down as follows:

* Basic map with OSM tiles
* OS-GB Map with Ordnance Survey tiles
* GeoJSON layer with markers
    * Info for GeoJSON layer
* WMS layer
    * Info for WMS layer

## Getting started

### Get a copy of the repository

First clone or download (and unzip) [the repository from GitHub](https://github.com/AstunTechnology/osgis-ol3-leaflet) to a suitable location on your local machine.

    git clone https://github.com/AstunTechnology/osgis-ol3-leaflet.git

Now you're ready to [start building an OpenLayers 3 map](ol3/README.md).

## Todo

* Set up another demo WMS layer

## Extra credit

* Style markers based on an attribute value
* Add additional WMS layer
